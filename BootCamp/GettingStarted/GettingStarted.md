# Getting Started with JumpScale

For this getting started tutorial you will need root access to a Linux server.

If not yet the case, we recommend one of the following options:

 * [Installing Linux server on a virtual machine locally, hosted locally with VirtualBox](VirtualBox/VirtualBox.md)
 * [Creating a virtual machine running Linux, hosted online at Mothership1.com](Mothership1/Mothership1.md)

Once you have your Linux virtual machine running, you will want [connect over SSH to your virtual machine](Connect/Connect.md).

The you will [install JumpScale](JumpScale/JumpScale.md) in order to [get acquainted with JumpScale](JumpScale/GettingAcquainted.md)

Using [SSHFS](SSHFS/SSHFS.md) you will be able to edit files in your favorite GUI.

On a [page created from the command line interface (CLI)](JumpScale/creating_new_page_with_CLI.md) you will call [your first macro](JumpScale/create_your_first_macro.md).

Once you learned to [create your first actor](JumpScale/create_your_first_actor.md) you will [call the actor via macro](JumpScale/calling_actor_via_macro.md).

After having learned how to [execute a JumpScript for the Interactive Shell](JumpScale/executing_jumpscripts.md), you will [execute a JumpScript from an actor](JumpScale/execute_jumpscript_from_actor.md).

And finally you will [display the result of a JumpScript on a wiki page](JumpScale/display_result_from_jumpscript_on_wiki_page.md)
