### Cloud Broker Portal

The **Cloud Broker Portal** is one of the sub portals used by operators to manage all the clouds:

* **Cloud Broker Portal**
* Grid Portal
* At Your Service Portal
* Power Management Portal
* Storage Portal
* System Portal

<br/>The **Cloud Broker Portal** is the management interface, or broker, on top of all the clouds. The current implementation of the **Cloud Broker Portal** supports GigStack clouds. Support for other clouds, including OpenStack clouds, is under development.

In the **Cloud Broker Portal** operators deal with [Accounts](../Accounts/Accounts.md), [Cloud Spaces](../CloudSpaces/CloudSpaces.md), [Locations](../Locations/Locations.md), [Stacks](../Stacks/Stacks.md), [Images](../Images/Images.md), [Public Networks](../PublicNetworks/PublicNetworks.md), [Private Networks](../PrivateNetworks/PrivateNetworks.md), [Users](../Users/Users.md), [Groups](../Groups/Groups.md) and [Virtual Machines](../VirtualMachines/VirtualMachines.md).


The **Dashboard** section shows the number of active accounts, the total number of running virtual machines and the number of running Windows virtual machines:
