### Accounts

In order for a user to get access to actual cloud resources he needs to have access rights to an account.

The **Accounts** page lists all existing accounts:

## Adding/creating Accounts

Creating a new account is simple. Just click on the **+ Add Account** link which will pop-up the **Create Account** window:

If the username you specify in the **Create Account** dialog doesn't exist yet, a new user will be created, and an activation email will be send to the email address you specify, allowing the user to set his password.

In case the username already exists, you can leave the email address field empty, no activation e-mail will be send anyway.

Once the account has been created it will appear in the accounts list, from which you can navigate to the **Account Details** page.
