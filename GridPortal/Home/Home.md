### Grid Portal Home

The **Grid Portal** is one of the sub portals used by operators to manage all the GigStack clouds:

* Cloud Broker Portal
* **Grid Portal**
* At Your Service Portal
* Power Management Portal
* Storage Portal
* System Portal

<br/>While the **Cloud Broker Portal** is the management interface, or broker, on top of any cloud stack, the **Grid Portal** provides a representation of the physical reality of a GigStack cloud, the native/propietary cloud stack of OpenvCloud.

The **Grid Portal** deals with [Audits](../Audits/Audits.md), [Error Conditions](../ErrorConditions/ErrorsConditions.md), [Jobs](../Jobs/Jobs.md), [JobQueues](../JobQueues/JobQueues.md), [JumpScripts](../JumpScripts/JumpScripts.md), [Logs](../Logs/Logs.md), [Grid Nodes](../GridNodes/GridNodes.md), [Status Overview](..StatusOverview/StatusOverview.md) and [Virtual Machines](../VirtualMachines/VirtualMachines.md).

On the home page of the **Grid Portal** a dashboard is shown with the number of event that occurred during last 24 hours and the number of running virtual machines:

From here you can navigate to the [Grid Nodes](../GridNodes/GridNodes.md), [Jobs](../Jobs/Jobs.md) and the [Status Overview](../StatusOverview/StatusOverview.md) pages, or via the left navigation to any other portal page.
